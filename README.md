# Java OOP Exam Practice – File to Database

## About the Project
This project is based on an **old Java exam assignment** that I used for practice in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
The goal of the program is to:
1. **Read data from a file**
2. **Store the data in a database**
3. **Retrieve and display specific data** through a terminal-based interface

It was created purely for learning purposes and to strengthen my skills in Java, file handling, database integration, and console-based interaction.

---

##  Purpose
- Practice **Object-Oriented Programming** principles in Java
- Work with **file I/O** to read and parse data
- Learn how to **connect Java to a database** and perform CRUD operations
- Build a simple **terminal program** for querying and displaying data

---

##  Status
**Not a production project** – this is a practice exercise based on an old exam task.  
Some parts are implemented, but the project is not fully complete.

---

## Possible Improvements
- Implement more robust error handling
- Add validation for file input
- Expand database queries and filtering options
- Improve terminal output formatting

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Java** (Object-Oriented Programming)
- **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity)
- **MySQL** (for database operations)
- **Terminal/Console** for user interaction
